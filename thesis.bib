	abstract = {We present initial results of the first self-consistent numerical model of the outer magnetosphere of a pulsar. By using the relativistic ``particle-in-cell'' method with special boundary conditions to represent plasma dynamics in 3D, we are able to follow magnetospheric plasma through the light cylinder into the wind zone for arbitrary magnetic inclination angles. For aligned rotators we confirm the ``disk-dome'' charge-separated structure of the magnetosphere and find that this configuration is unstable to a 3D non-axisymmetric diocotron instability. This instability allows plasma to move across the field lines and approach the corotating Goldreich-Julian solution within several rotation periods. For oblique rotators formation of the spiral ``striped wind'' in the equatorial direction is demonstrated and the acceleration of the wind and its magnetization is discussed. We find that the wind properties vary with stellar latitude; however, whether injection conditions at the pulsar are responsible for the observed jet-equator geometry of the Crab and Vela pulsars is currently under investigation. We also comment on the electrodynamics of the simulated magnetospheres, their current closure, and future simulations.},

	abstract = {A radiative model for the soft gamma repeaters and the energetic 1979 
March 5 burst is presented. We identify the sources of these bursts with
neutron stars the external magnetic fields of which are much stronger
than those of ordinary pulsars. Several independent arguments point to a
neutron star with B\_dipole{\textasciitilde}5x10{\textasciicircum}14 G as the source of the March 5 event.
A very strong field can (i) spin down the star to an 8-s period in the
{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}4-yr age of the surrounding supernova remnant N49; (ii) provide
enough energy for the March 5 event; (iii) undergo a large-scale
interchange instability the growth time of which is comparable to the
{\textasciitilde}0.2-s width of the initial hard transient phase of the March 5 event;
(iv) confine the energy that was radiated in the soft tail of that
burst; (v) reduce the Compton scattering cross-section sufficiently to
generate a radiative flux that is {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}4 times the (non-magnetic)
Eddington flux; (vi) decay significantly in {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}4-10{\textasciicircum}5 yr, as is
required to explain the activity of soft gamma repeater sources on this
time-scale; and (vii) power the quiescent X-ray emission L\_X{\textasciitilde}7x10{\textasciicircum}35 erg
s{\textasciicircum}-1 observed by Einstein and ROSAT as it diffuses the stellar interior.
We propose that the 1979 March 5 event was triggered by a large-scale
reconnection/interchange instability of the stellar magnetic field, and
the soft repeat bursts by cracking of the crust. The hard initial spike
of the March 5 event is identified with an expanding pair fireball, and
the soft tail of that burst, together with the short, soft repeat
bursts, with a pair plasma trapped in the stellar magnetosphere. We
construct a detailed radiative model that describes the cooling of such
a plasma. The opacity is dominated by the electron-baryon contaminant in
a cold surface layer, and the plasma releases energy as the edge of the
pair-dominated region propagates inward, in a cooling wave. The rate at
which the plasma volume contracts is limited either by the rate of
advection of heat toward the stellar surface (where the field is
strongest and the scattering opacity weakest), or by ablation of ions
and electrons from the stellar surface. The effective temperature of the
surface radiation depends only on the surface magnetic field strength in
the regime where the radiative flux is limited by ablation from the
neutron star surface (which is the regime of interest in the March 5
event), and otherwise is weakly dependent on the plasma energy density.
We argue that the deposition of equivalent energy in a much weaker
magnetic field (characteristic of ordinary pulsars) necessarily
generates a very high scattering depth which chokes off the radiative
flow on the observed {\textasciitilde}0.1-s time-scale of soft gamma repeater bursts.
Indeed, we suggest that the same basic magnetospheric emission mechanism
operates at lower field strengths (B{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}12 G) in Type II X-ray bursts,
which have much lower luminosities than soft gamma repeater bursts.
Important magnetic radiative effects include the suppression of Compton
scattering in the extraordinary polarization mode, and stimulated photon
splitting. We derive the Boltzmann equations for the photon occupation
number which describe simulated photon splitting, as well as photon
merging. We show that the net splitting rate vanishes in thermal
equilibrium. Radiative diffusion occurs primarily in the E-mode,
although rapid scattering of the O-mode ensures convergence of the
photon distribution function to a Bose-Einstein form. This allows us to
write down diffusion equations for the photon energy flux and number
flux as linear superpositions of gradients in the temperature and
chemical potential. The transition from a Planck to a Bose-Einstein
spectrum occurs at T{\textasciitilde}10 keV. Photon splitting at higher temperatures can
impede free-streaming of photons across the magnetic field lines, but
splitting of high-energy photons is impeded by the inverse process of
photon merging. We demonstrate that only a small fraction of the pair
bubble energy can be conducted into the crust during the lifetime of the
burst. We discuss the radiative ablation of matter from the heated
stellar surface after the magnetospheric pair plasma is dissipated. The
ensuing surface afterglow is typically {\textasciitilde}1 per cent of the burst
luminosity. Direct pair neutrino cooling of the plasma is shown to be
unimportant for soft gamma repeater bursts, but may help to determine
the light curve of the March 5 event. Finally, we make a critical
comparison between this model and models in which the soft gamma
repeater bursts are triggered by accretion and/or involve surface
cooling.},

simulations of the oblique pulsar magnetosphere with pair formation. The
magnetosphere starts to form with particles extracted from the surface
of the neutron star. These particles are accelerated by surface electric
fields and emit photons capable of producing electron-positron
pairs. We inject secondary pairs at the locations of primary energetic
particles whose energy exceeds the threshold for pair formation. We find
solutions that are close to the ideal force-free magnetosphere with the
Y-point and current sheet. Solutions with obliquities <=40{\textdegree} do not
show pair production in the open field line region because the local
current density along the magnetic field is below the
Goldreich-Julian value. The bulk outflow in these solutions is
charge-separated, and pair formation happens in the current sheet and
return current layer only. Solutions with higher inclinations show pair
production in the open field line region, with high multiplicity of the
bulk flow and the size of the pair-producing region increasing with
inclination. We observe the spin-down of the star to be comparable to
MHD model predictions. The magnetic dissipation in the current sheet
ranges between 20\% for the aligned rotator and 3\% for the orthogonal
rotator. Our results suggest that for low obliquity neutron stars with
suppressed pair formation at the light cylinder, the presence of
phenomena related to pair activity in the bulk of the polar region,
e.g., radio emission, may crucially depend on the physics beyond our
simplified model, such as the effects of curved spacetime or multipolar
surface fields.},

The discussion is concerned with the class of (mainly young) pulsars which can sustain pair production in otherwise charge-depleted regions of the outer magnetosphere. The resulting electrostatic accelerating region ("gap") is expected to exist far from the neutron star, where a corotating magnetosphere would be rotating at speeds a significant fraction of c.

The evolution of coronal arcades in response to applied shearing photospheric flows indicates that disruptive behavior can occur beyond a critical shear. The disruption can be traced to ideal MHD magnetic nonequilibrium. The magnetic field expands outward in a process that opens the field lines and produces a tangential discontinuity in the magnetic field. In the presence of plasma resistivity, the resulting current sheet is the site of rapid reconnection, leading to an impulsive release of magnetic energy, fast flows, and the ejection of a plasmoid. We relate these results to previous studies of force-free fields and to the properties of the open-field configuration. We show that the field lines in an arcade are forced open when the magnetic energy approaches (but is still below) the open-field energy, creating a partially open field in which most of the field lines extend away from the solar surface. Preliminary application of this model to helmet streamers indicates that it is relevant to the initiation of coronal mass ejections.},

An elevated level of emission tail is detected after the brightest burst, persisting for \~{}1 ks. The emission showed a power-law decay with a temporal index of 0.5 before returning to the persistent emission level. The long observation also provided detailed phase-resolved spectra of the persistent X-ray emission of the source. By comparing the persistent spectrum with that previously reported, we find that the source hard-band emission has been stable for over approximately 10 yr. The persistent hard-X-ray emission is well fitted by a coronal outflow model, where e{\textpm} pairs in the magnetosphere upscatter
thermal X-rays. Our fit of phase-resolved spectra allowed us to estimate the angle between the rotational and magnetic dipole axes of the magnetar, \{$\alpha$ \}\{mag\}=0.25, the twisted magnetic flux,
2.5 {\texttimes} 1026 G cm2, and the power released in the twisted magnetosphere, \{L\}j = 6 {\texttimes} 1036 erg s-1. Assuming this model for the hard-X-ray
spectrum, the soft-X-ray component is well fit by a two-blackbody model, with the hotter blackbody consistent with the footprint of the twisted magnetic field lines on the star. We also report on the 3 yr Swift monitoring observations obtained since 2011 July.

reconnection. Using 2D spherical particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate particle acceleration in the axisymmetric pulsar
magnetosphere as a function of the injected plasma multiplicity and magnetization. We observe a clear transition from a highly
charge-separated magnetosphere for low plasma injection with little current and spin-down power, to a nearly force-free solution for high plasma multiplicity characterized by a prominent equatorial current sheet and high spin-down power. We find significant magnetic dissipation in the current sheet, up to 30 per cent within 5 light-cylinder radii in the high-multiplicity regime. The simulations unambiguously demonstrate that the dissipated Poynting flux is efficiently channelled to the particles in the sheet, close to the Y-point within about 1-2
light-cylinder radii from the star. The mean particle energy in the sheet is given by the upstream plasma magnetization at the light cylinder. The study of particle orbits shows that all energetic
particles originate from the boundary layer between the open and the closed field lines. Energetic positrons always stream outwards, while high-energy electrons precipitate back towards the star through the sheet and along the separatrices, which may result in auroral-like emission. Our results suggest that the current sheet and the

	abstract = {We develop a theoretical model that explains the formation of hot coronae around strongly magnetized neutron stars-magnetars. The starquakes of a magnetar shear its external magnetic field, which becomes nonpotential and threaded by an electric current. Once twisted, the magnetosphere cannot untwist immediately because of its self-induction. The self-induction electric field lifts particles from the stellar surface, accelerates them, and initiates avalanches of pair creation in the magnetosphere. The created plasma corona maintains the electric current demanded by b.nabla XB and regulates the self-induction EMF by screening. This corona persists in dynamic equilibrium: it is continually lost to the stellar surface on the light crossing time {\textasciitilde}10-4 s and replenished with new particles. In essence, the twisted magnetosphere acts as an accelerator that converts the toroidal field energy to particle kinetic energy. Using a direct numerical experiment, we show that the corona self-organizes quickly (on a millisecond timescale) into a quasi-steady state, with voltage 108-109 V along the magnetic lines. The voltage is maintained near the threshold for e+/- discharge. The heating rate of the corona is {\textasciitilde}1036 ergs s-1, in agreement with the observed persistent, high-energy output of magnetars. We deduce that a static twist that is suddenly implanted into the magnetosphere will decay on a timescale of 1-10 yr. The particles accelerated in the corona impact the solid crust, knock out protons, and regulate the column density of the hydrostatic atmosphere of the star. The transition layer between the atmosphere and corona may be hot enough to create additional e+/- pairs. This layer can be the source of the observed 100 keV emission from magnetars. The corona emits curvature radiation and can supply the observed IR-optical luminosity.},

	abstract = {We explore the pulsar slot gap (SG) electrodynamics up to very high altitudes, where for most relatively rapidly rotating pulsars both the standard small-angle approximation and the assumption that the magnetic field lines are ideal streamlines break down. We address the importance of the electrodynamic conditions at the SG boundaries and the occurrence of a steady state drift of charged particles across the SG field lines at very high altitudes. These boundary conditions and the deviation of particle trajectories from streamlines determine the asymptotic behavior of the scalar potential at all radii from the polar cap (PC) to near the light cylinder. As a result, we demonstrate that the steady state accelerating electric field, E{\textbar}{\textbar}, must approach a small and constant value at high altitude above the PC. This E{\textbar}{\textbar} is capable of maintaining electrons moving with high Lorentz factors ({\textasciitilde}few{\texttimes}107) and emitting curvature gamma-ray photons
up to nearly the light cylinder. By numerical simulations, we show that primary electrons accelerating from the PC surface to high altitude in the SG along the outer edge of the open field region will form caustic emission patterns on the trailing dipole field lines. Acceleration and emission in such an extended SG may form the physical basis of a model that can successfully reproduce some pulsar high-energy light curves.},

	abstract = {Magnetar magnetospheres are believed to be strongly twisted, due to shearing of the stellar crust by internal magnetic stresses. We present time-dependent axisymmetric simulations showing in detail the evolution of relativistic force-free magnetospheres subjected to slow twisting through large angles. When the twist amplitude is small, the magnetosphere moves quasi-statically through a sequence of equilibria of increasing free energy. At some twist amplitude the magnetosphere becomes tearing-mode unstable to forming a resistive current sheet, initiating large-scale magnetic reconnection in which a significant fraction of the magnetic free energy can be dissipated. This "critical" twist angle is insensitive to the resistive length scale. Rapid shearing temporarily stabilizes the magnetosphere beyond the critical angle, allowing the magnetosphere of a rapidly differentially rotating star to store, and dissipate, more free energy. In addition to these effects, shearing the surface of a rotating star increases the spindown torque applied to the star. If shearing is much slower than rotation, the resulting spikes in spindown rate can occur on timescales anywhere from the long twisting timescale to the stellar spin period or shorter, depending both on the stellar shear distribution and the existing distribution of magnetospheric twists. A model in which energy is stored in the magnetosphere, and released by a magnetospheric instability, therefore predicts large changes in the measured spindown rate before SGR giant flares.},

	abstract = {We report the results of an investigation of particle acceleration and electron-positron plasma generation at low altitude in the polar magnetic flux tubes of rotation-powered pulsars, when the stellar surface is free to emit whatever charges and currents are demanded by the force-free magnetosphere. We apply a new 1D hybrid plasma simulation code to the dynamical problem, using Particle-in-Cell methods for the dynamics of the charged particles, including a determination of the collective electrostatic fluctuations in the plasma, combined with a Monte Carlo treatment of the high-energy gamma-rays that mediate the formation of the electron-positron pairs. We assume the electric current flowing through the pair creation zone is fixed by the much higher inductance magnetosphere, and adopt the results of force-free magnetosphere models to provide the currents which must be carried by the accelerator. The models are spatially one dimensional, and designed to explore the physics, although of practical relevance to young, high-voltage pulsars. We observe novel behaviour (a) When the current density j is less than the Goldreich-Julian value (0 {\textless} j/jGJ {\textless} 1), space charge limited acceleration of the current carrying beam is mild, with the full Goldreich-Julian charge density comprising the charge densities of the beam and a cloud of electrically trapped particles with the same sign of charge as the beam. The voltage drops are of the order of mc2/e, and pair creation is absent. (b) When the current density exceeds the Goldreich-Julian value (j/jGJ {\textgreater} 1), the system develops high voltage drops (TV or greater), causing emission of curvature gamma-rays and intense bursts of pair creation. The bursts exhibit limit cycle behaviour, with characteristic time-scales somewhat longer than the relativistic fly-by time over distances comparable to the polar cap diameter (microseconds). (c) In return current regions, where j/jGJ {\textless} 0, the system develops similar bursts of pair creation. These discharges are similar to those encountered in previous calculations by Timokhin of pair creation when the surface has a high work function and cannot freely emit charge. In cases (b) and (c), the intermittently generated pairs allow the system to simultaneously carry the magnetospherically prescribed currents and adjust the charge density and average electric field to force-free conditions. We also elucidate the conditions for pair creating beam flow to be steady (stationary with small fluctuations in the rotating frame), finding that such steady flows can occupy only a small fraction of the current density parameter space exhibited by the force-free magnetospheric model. The generic polar flow dynamics and pair creation are strongly time dependent. The model has an essential difference from almost all previous quantitative studies, in that we sought the accelerating voltage (with pair creation, when the voltage drops are sufficiently large; without, when they are small) as a function of the applied current. The 1D results described here characterize the dependence of acceleration and pair creation on the magnitude and sign of current. The dependence on the spatial distribution of the current is a multi-dimensional problem, possibly exhibiting more chaotic behaviour. We briefly outline possible relations of the electric field fluctuations observed in the polar flows (both with and without pair creation discharges) to direct emission of radio waves, as well as revive the possible relation of the observed limit cycle behaviour to microstructure in the radio emission. Actually modelling these effects requires the multi-dimensional treatment, to be reported in a later paper.},

large-scale electrical currents and the effect of resonant Compton
scattering by the charge carriers (both electrons and ions) on the
emergent X-ray spectra and pulse profiles. In the magnetar model for the
soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs), these
currents are maintained by magnetic stresses acting deep inside the
star, which generate both sudden disruptions (SGR outbursts) and more
gradual plastic deformations of the rigid crust. We construct
self-similar force-free equilibria of the current-carrying magnetosphere
with a power-law dependence of magnetic field on radius,
B{\textasciitilde}r-(2+p), and show that a large-scale twist of field lines
softens the radial dependence of the magnetic field to p{\textless}1. The
spin-down torque acting on the star is thereby increased in comparison
with an orthogonal vacuum dipole. We comment on the strength of the
surface magnetic field in the SGR and AXP sources, as inferred from
their measured spin-down rates, and the implications of this model for
the narrow measured distribution of spin periods. A magnetosphere with a
strong twist [B$\varphi$/B$\theta$=O(1) at the
equator] has an optical depth {\textasciitilde}1 to resonant cyclotron scattering,
independent of frequency (radius), surface magnetic field strength, or
charge/mass ratio of the scattering charge. When electrons and ions
supply the current, the stellar surface is also heated by the impacting
charges at a rate comparable to the observed X-ray output of the SGR and
AXP sources, if Bdipole{\textasciitilde}1014 G. Redistribution of
the emerging X-ray flux at the cyclotron resonance will strongly modify
the emerging pulse profile and, through the Doppler effect, generate a
nonthermal tail to the X-ray spectrum. We relate the sudden change in
the pulse profile of SGR 1900+14 following the 1998 August 27 giant
flare to an enhanced optical depth at the electron cyclotron resonance
resulting from a sudden twist imparted to the external magnetic field
during the flare. The self-similar structure of the magnetosphere should
generate frequency-independent profiles; more complicated pulse profiles
may reflect the presence of higher multipoles, ion cyclotron scattering,
or possibly nonresonant Compton scattering of O-mode photons by
pair-loaded currents.},

Although progress has been made in understanding the relevant processes involved, there are several widely held misconceptions that are inhibiting further advances. These include the idea that plasma ``must'' be accelerated from the magnetic polar caps (the basis for the ``Hollow Cone Model'') and the idea that winds would be driven away by centrifugal forces, with large amplitude electromagnetic waves playing no role whatsoever. However, recent theoretical work is converging on a picture that closely resembles the latest HST and Chandra images, providing hope for the future. No less than three groups have recently confirmed the early Krause-Polstorff-Michel simulations showing that the fundamental plasma distribution around a rotating neutron star consists of two polar domes and an equatorial torus of trapped nonneutral plasma of opposite sign charges. Unless a lot of new physics can be added, this distribution renders the Goldreich-Julian model irrelevant (i.e., along with most of the theoretical publications over the last 33 years).},

and we follow the coupled evolution of its external electromagnetic
field and plasma particles using the "particle-in-cell" method. A plasma
magnetosphere begins to form through the extraction of particles from
the star; these particles are accelerated by the rotation-induced
electric field, producing curvature radiation and igniting e
{\textpm} discharge. We follow the system evolution for
several revolution periods, longer than required to reach a quasi-steady
state. Our numerical experiment puts to test previous ideas for the
plasma flow and gaps in the pulsar magnetosphere. We first consider
rotators capable of producing pairs out to the light cylinder through
photon-photon collisions. We find that their magnetospheres are similar
to the previously obtained force-free solutions with a Y-shaped current
sheet. The magnetosphere continually ejects e {\textpm} pairs
and ions. Pair creation is sustained by a strong electric field along
the current sheet. We observe powerful curvature and synchrotron
emission from the current sheet, consistent with Fermi observations of
gamma-ray pulsars. We then study pulsars that can only create pairs in
the strong-field region near the neutron star, well inside the light
cylinder. We find that both aligned and anti-aligned rotators relax to
the "dead" state with suppressed pair creation and electric currents,

	abstract = {To explain the pulsed emission of the rotation powered pulsars from radio to gamma-ray, polar cap models, slot gap models, and outer gap models are proposed. Recent observations suggest that these models are likely to co-exist in the same magnetosphere. If so, their mutual relation is known to be troublesome (Harding 2009), due to the boundary conditions and the direction of the current, which are properly assumed in each acceleration model. We performed a particle simulation for the global magnetospheric structure. Based on this simulation, we present a new picture of the global structure of the pulsar magnetosphere. It is found that a new dead zone is formed along the current neutral line that separates the oppositely directed current. We shall call this the current-neutral zone. We suggest that the polar cap accelerators and the slot gaps locate above the current-neutral zone, and the outer gap exist between the current neutral zone and the traditional dead zone. We also give an estimate of the super-rotation region.},

The incorporation of the dragging effect of inertial frames of reference made it possible to demonstrate the possibility of generation of an electric field component, which is relativistic in origin and is proportional to cos chi, where chi is the inclination angle of a pulsar.

	abstract = {Magnetospheres of neutron stars are anchored in the rigid crust and can be twisted by sudden crustal motions ("starquakes"). The twisted magnetosphere does not remain static and gradually untwists, dissipating magnetic energy and producing radiation. The equation describing this evolution is derived, and its solutions are presented. Two distinct regions coexist in untwisting magnetospheres: a potential region where ? {\texttimes} B = 0 ("cavity") and a current-carrying bundle of field lines with ? {\texttimes} B /= 0 ("j-bundle"). The cavity has a sharp boundary, which expands with time and eventually erases all of the twist. In this process, the electric current of the j-bundle is sucked into the star. Observational appearance of the untwisting process is discussed. A hot spot forms at the footprints of the j-bundle. The spot shrinks with time toward the magnetic dipole axis, and its luminosity and temperature gradually decrease. As the j-bundle shrinks, the amplitude of its twist $\psi$ can grow to the maximum possible value $\psi$max {\textasciitilde} 1. The strong twist near the dipole axis increases the spindown rate of the star and can generate a broad beam of radio emission. The model explains the puzzling behavior of magnetar XTE J1810-197, a canonical example of magnetospheric evolution following a starquake. We also discuss implications for other magnetars. The untwisting theory suggests that the nonthermal radiation of magnetars is preferentially generated on a bundle of extended closed field lines near the dipole axis.},

	abstract = {In Aristotelian Electrodynamics (AE), due to radiation over-damping, the velocity rather than the acceleration of a charge is determined by the local electromagnetic field. Treating electrons and positrons separately, AE seems to give a faithful description of the flow of charges in a pulsar magnetosphere. AE might allow to calculate the pulsar emission in full detail, at all energies except the radio. But AE is not a full theory -- the plasma production processes must be added. Here we show that the pulsar magnetosphere and the resulting emission are sensitive to the plasma production rate near the light cylinder. In strong pulsars (high production rate, due to photon-photon collisions), the number of field lines closing beyond the light cylinder decreases. This reduces both the pulsar efficiency (the ratio of the pulsed bolometric luminosity to the spin-down power) and the characteristic photon energy, in overall agreement with the Fermi data. For weak pulsars (low production rate), our numerical implementation of AE works stably and seems to be ready to calculate the lightcurves and spectra. But for strong pulsars, the code (included) needs improvement or better understanding.},

	abstract = {We present a new model of high-energy light curves from rotation-powered pulsars. The key ingredient of the model is the gap region (i.e., the region where particle acceleration is taking place and high-energy photons originate) that satisfies the following assumptions: (1) the gap region extends from each polar cap to the light cylinder; (2) the gap is thin and confined to the surface of last open magnetic-field lines; (3) photon emissivity is uniform within the gap region. The model light curves are dominated by strong peaks (either double or single) of caustic origin. Unlike other pulsar models with caustic effects, the double peaks arise from a crossing two caustics, each of which is associated with a different magnetic pole. The generic features of the light curves are consistent with the observed characteristics of pulsar light curves: (1) the most natural (in terms of probability) shape consists of two peaks (separated by 0.4 to 0.5 in phase for large viewing angles); (2) the peaks possess well-developed wings; (3) there is a bridge (interpeak) emission component; (4) there is a nonvanishing off-pulse emission level; (5) the radio pulse occurs before the leading high-energy peak. The model is well suited for four gamma-ray
pulsars-Crab, Vela, Geminga, and B1951+32-with double-peak light curves exhibiting the peak separation of 0.4 to 0.5 in phase. Here we apply the model to the Vela pulsar. Moreover, we indicate the limitation of the model in accurate reproducing of the light curves with single pulses and narrowly separated (about 0.2 in phase) pulse peaks. We also discuss the optical polarization properties for the Crab pulsar in the context of the two-pole caustic model.},

The outflow energy is processed into copious e {\textpm} until the plasma enters outer parts of the loop where the magnetic field is reduced below 1013 G. In the outer zone, photons scattered by the outflow do not convert to e {\textpm} pairs and the outflow radiates its energy away. The escaping radiation forms a distinct hard X-ray peak in the magnetar spectrum. It has the following features: (1) its luminosity L = 1035-1036 erg s-1 can easily exceed the thermal luminosity from the magnetar surface, (2) its spectrum extends from 10 keV to the MeV band with a hard spectral slope, which depends on the object inclination to the line of sight, (3) the anisotropic hard X-ray emission exhibits strong pulsations as the magnetar spins, (4) the emission spectrum typically peaks around 1 MeV, but the peak position significantly oscillates with the spin period, (5) the emission is dominated by the extraordinary polarization mode at photon energies below {\textasciitilde}1 MeV, and (6) the decelerated pairs accumulate and annihilate at the top of the magnetic loop, and emit the 511 keV line with luminosity L ann {\textasciitilde} 0.1 L.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09077},
	abstract = {We examine four candidate mechanisms that could explain the high surface temperatures of magnetars. (1) Heat flux from the liquid core heated by ambipolar diffusion. It could sustain the observed surface luminosity \$L\_s{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{35\}\$ erg/s if core heating offsets neutrino cooling at a temperature \$T\_\{core\}{\textgreater}6{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}8\$ K. This scenario is viable if the core magnetic field exceeds \$10{\textasciicircum}\{16\}\$ G and the heat-blanketing envelope of the magnetar has a light element composition. We find however that the lifetime of such a hot core should be shorter than the typical observed lifetime of magnetars. (2) Mechanical dissipation in the solid crust. This heating can be quasi-steady, powered by gradual (or frequent) crustal yielding to magnetic stresses. We show that it obeys a strong upper limit. As long as the crustal stresses are fostered by the field evolution in the core or Hall drift in the crust, mechanical heating is insufficient to sustain persistent \$L\_s{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{35\}\$ erg/s. The surface luminosity is increased in an alternative scenario of mechanical deformations triggered by external magnetospheric flares. (3) Ohmic dissipation in the crust, in volume or current sheets. This mechanism is inefficient because of the high conductivity of the crust. Only extreme magnetic configurations with crustal fields \$B{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{16\}\$ G varying on a 100 meter scale could provide \$L\_s{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{35\}\$ erg/s. (4) Bombardment of the stellar surface by particles accelerated in the magnetosphere. This mechanism produces hot spots on magnetars.

The problem of plasma motion in the self-consistent radiation field is solved using the method of virtual beams. The plasma and radiation exchange momentum via resonant scattering and self-organize into the "radiatively locked" outflow with a well-defined, decreasing Lorentz factor. There is an extended zone around the magnetar where the plasma flow is ultra-relativistic; its Lorentz factor is self-regulated so that it can marginally scatter thermal photons. The flow becomes slow and opaque in an outer equatorial zone, where the decelerated plasma accumulates and annihilates; this region serves as a reflector for the thermal photons emitted by the neutron star. The e+- flow carries electric current, which is sustained by a moderate induced electric field. The electric field maintains a separation between the electron and positron velocities, against the will of the radiation field. The two-stream instability is then inevitable, and the induced turbulence can generate low-frequency emission. In particular, radio emission may escape around the magnetic dipole axis of the star. Most of the flow energy is converted to hard X-ray emission, which is examined in the accompanying paper.},

Recent observations of shrinking hot spots on magnetars are consistent with this behavior. (2) Continual discharge fills the j-bundle with e{\textpm} plasma, maintaining a nonthermal corona around the neutron
star. The corona outside a few stellar radii strongly interacts with the stellar radiation and forms a "radiatively locked" outflow with a high e{\textpm} multiplicity. The locked plasma annihilates near the apexes of the closed magnetic field lines. (3) New radiative-transfer simulations suggest a simple mechanismthat shapes the observed X-ray spectrumfrom 0.1 keV to 1MeV: part of the thermal X-rays emitted by the neutron star are reflected from the outer corona and then upscattered by the inner relativistic outflow in the j-bundle, producing a beam of hard X-rays.},

These dissipative regions arise self-consistently, since we do not have any explicit dissipation in the code. A minimum of \$ {\textbackslash}approx 20{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the electromagnetic spindown luminosity is transferred to the particles in the dissipative regions, predominantly in the vicinity of the Y-point. The value of the spindown luminosity is in rough agreement with the force-free value, but can differ by tens of percent even when the characteristic magnetization at the light cylinder is high (\${\textbackslash}sigma {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}3-10{\textasciicircum}4\$). This is because the magnetization in the vicinity of the Y-point is orders of magnitude lower than the characteristic magnetization at the light cylinder.

The pair density saturates at N+/-{\textasciitilde}=E20/(8$\pi$mec2$\Gamma$thr), where E0 is the parallel electric field in the charge-starved initial state and $\Gamma$thr is the Lorentz factor for effective pair creation. The frequency of oscillations following the pair creation burst is given roughly by $\omega$osc=eE0/(8mec$\Gamma$thr). A positive feedback keeps the system stable, such that the average pair creation rate balances the loss rate due to pairs escaping the magnetosphere.},

	abstract = {A model for the plasma atmosphere about a rotating magnetized neutron star with aligned magnetic and rotational axes is developed using a gedanken experiment in order to avoid considering at one time all of the phenomena produced by the extreme parameters associated with real pulsars. In this approach, the angular velocity of the star is
adiabatically increased in time, with the two axes aligned so that no dependence on the toroidal variable is introduced. The conclusions which appear to yield a consistent model are: (1) the star acquires a net charge that produces a monopole electric field which dominates the dipole magnetic field at large distances and causes particles emitted at the polar caps to cross the magnetic surface at these distances, forming a current loop between the caps and the polar annuli; (2) the primary current loop is not connected to the nebula and produces no energy loss due to particle emission into it; (3) a steady-state (possibly
turbulent) component of the atmosphere exists around a force-free surface which forms a dome over the polar cap; (4) the dome will have a continuous influx from primary beam particles, which are trapped due to their radiation loss; and (5) the toroidal drift velocity is not corotational, which is consistent with closed magnetic-field lines.},

Here we examine the stability of a simplified model of this belt. The model consists of a charged thin plasma disc in differential rotation, embedded in a dipolar magnetic field anchored in the neutron star. In the linearized electrostatic perturbation approximation, this disc appears to be unstable to the so-called diocotron instability. We present several eigenspectra and eigenfunctions for different disc models, which differ by the total charge of the disc-star system. Velocity and electric field
perturbations are also shown in the disc plane for a few fast-growing modes. Increasing the total charge has a stabilizing effect, in the sense that the growth rate of the fastest-growing eigenvalue decreases with total charge and eventually vanishes. When the system is unstable, the growth rates are of the order of the azimuthal rotation rate. This means that the diocotron instability, which develops in a few pulsar's periods, should be very efficient in causing particles to migrate across magnetic surfaces.},

Since the
characteristic equations of the flow are solved, there are no numerical diffusion terms obscuring the cause of the transfield motion. The obtained properties of type II magnetosphere are as follows: plasma particles in fact flow out across the closed magnetic-field lines; centrifugal force is exerted powerfully on the positive particles to form a disk-like structure, and the strong electric force makes the negative particles drift to the disk; and the electric field parallel to the disk (Ep) appears and is shown to be necessary for the steady wind to exist. Within the range of the model parameters selected, two reasons for the appearance of Ep are found: plasma density decreases owing to the centrifugal acceleration and becomes insufficient to shield Ep, and the plasma with large inertia moves so as to reduce the charge
separation, which would be necessary to shield Ep.},

As a sequel to our previous paper, we carried out a three-dimensional
particle simulation for the axisymmetric global magnetosphere. We
present the results of additional calculations, which are higher
resolution models and higher pair creation rate cases, and a detailed
analysis for the solution. We confined our work to demonstrating the
cases of low pair creation rates, i.e. where the magnetic field is a
fixed dipole. The radiation drag of the plasma was taken to be in a form
with the curvature radius along the dipole magnetic field. The
electrostatic interactions were calculated using a programmable
special-purpose computer, GRAPE-DR. We found that once pair creation
begins in the outer gaps, both positively and negatively charged
particles begin to drift across the closed magnetic field due to
radiation drag, and they create an outflow. Eventually, the steady
magnetosphere has outer gaps, both positively and negatively charged
outflow of plasma and a region in which the electric field is dominant
extending from the equator. In the steady state, the magnetic field
generated by the magnetospheric current is comparable to the dipole
magnetic field outside several light radii from the star. In a much
higher pair creation rate model, the effect of the modification of the
magnetic field will bring about modification of the outflow of the
plasma, requiring further study with a higher pair creation rate model
in a subsequent paper.},

powerful events during which luminosities can reach up to

Substantial progress has been made also on the theoretical side. Quite detailed models for explaining the magnetars{\textquoteright} persistent x-ray
emission, the properties of the bursts, the flux evolution in transient sources have been developed and confronted with observations. New insight on neutron star asteroseismology has been gained through improved models of magnetar oscillations. The long-debated issue of magnetic field decay in neutron stars has been addressed, and its importance recognized in relation to the evolution of magnetars and to the links among magnetars and other families of isolated neutron stars. The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive overview in which the observational results are discussed in the light of the most up-to-date theoretical models and their implications. This addresses not only the particular case of magnetar sources, but the more fundamental issue of how physics in strong magnetic fields can be constrained by the observations of these unique sources.},

field-line expansion and opening) are considered, and a comparison is
made between two different geometrical settings: the Cartesian case with
translational symmetry along a straight line, and the axisymmetric case
with axial symmetry around the rotation axis. The main question
addressed in the paper is whether a continuous sequence of force-free
equilibria describes the evolution at arbitrarily large values of the
footpoint displacement, or the sequence ends abruptly and the system
exhibits a loss of equilibrium at a finite footpoint displacement. After
a formal description of the problem, a review/discussion of the
extensive previous work on the subject is given. After that, a series of
simple scaling-type arguments, explaining the key essential reason for
the main qualitative difference between the two geometry types, is
presented. It is found that, in the Cartesian case, force-free
equilibria exist at arbitrarily large values of shear and the field
approaches the open state only at infinite shear, whereas in the
axisymmetric case the field opens up already at a finite shear.},

We test the model against observations of three magnetars: 4U 0142+61, 1RXS J1708-4009, and 1E 1841-045. We find that the model successfully fits the observed phase-resolved spectra. We derive constraints on the angle between the rotational and magnetic axes of the neutron star, the object inclination to the line of sight, and the size of the active twisted region filled with the plasma flow. Using the fit of the hard X-ray component of the magnetar spectrum, we revisit the remaining soft X-ray component. We find that it can be explained by a modified
two-temperature blackbody model. The hotter blackbody is consistent with a hot spot covering 1\%-10\% of the neutron star surface. Such a hot spot is expected at the base of the magnetospheric e {\textpm}

reconnection events initiated by development of the tearing mode in magnetically dominated relativistic plasma. We formulate equations of resistive force-free electrodynamics, discuss the relation of the latter to ideal electrodynamics, and give examples of both ideal and resistive equilibria. Resistive force-free current layers are unstable towards the development of small-scale current sheets where resistive effects become important. Thin current sheets are found to be unstable due to the development of the resistive force-free tearing mode. The growth rate of the tearing mode is intermediate between the short Alfv{\'e}n

The observed distribution of pulsar spin periods and period derivatives, and the distribution of pulsars with missing radio pulses, is quantitatively consistent with the pair production threshold, when its variation of neutron star radius and moment of inertia with mass is taken into account. All neutron stars observed as pulsars can have relativistic magnetohydrodynamic wind exterior magnetospheres. The properties of the wind can be directly related to those of the pair production source. Radio pulsars cannot have relativistic plasma wave exterior magnetospheres. On the other hand, most erstwhile pulsars in the galaxy are probably halo objects that emit weak fluxes of energetic photons that can have relativistic wave exterior magnetospheres.

	abstract = {This introductory account of instabilities in plasmas concentrates on 
laboratory plasmas, such as those encountered in fusion research, and
the space plasmas studied in physics of the magnetosphere and solar
atmosphere.  This account bridges the gap between a graduate textbook on
plasma physics, and specialized similarities between astrophysical and
laboratory plasmas that are traditionally regarded as quite separate.
The author, an expert in plasma astrophysics who has written a
two-volume book on the subject, treats the material naturally, lending a
broader perspective to the subject.    This is an instructional text for
graduate students and professionals in magnetospheric and mathematical
physics, radiophysics, solar and theoretical astrophysics and radio
astronomy.},

	abstract = {The glitch model of Ruderman, Zhu \& Chen is applied to the problem of post-glitch relaxation. The energy dissipated in a glitch is such that motion of both solid and liquid phases during and after spin-up is strictly constrained to surfaces of constant chemical composition. The amorphous and heterogeneous nature of the solid phase of neutron star matter is used to deduce the qualitative form of the dissipative force acting on unit length of a neutron vortex as a function of its velocity. The analysis of post-glitch relaxation given here is necessarily qualitative owing to the stochastic nature of the model, but is
consistent with both the normal and anomalous cases observed.},
