	abstract = {We present initial results of the first self-consistent numerical model of the outer magnetosphere of a pulsar. By using the relativistic ``particle-in-cell'' method with special boundary conditions to represent plasma dynamics in 3D, we are able to follow magnetospheric plasma through the light cylinder into the wind zone for arbitrary magnetic inclination angles. For aligned rotators we confirm the ``disk-dome'' charge-separated structure of the magnetosphere and find that this configuration is unstable to a 3D non-axisymmetric diocotron instability. This instability allows plasma to move across the field lines and approach the corotating Goldreich-Julian solution within several rotation periods. For oblique rotators formation of the spiral ``striped wind'' in the equatorial direction is demonstrated and the acceleration of the wind and its magnetization is discussed. We find that the wind properties vary with stellar latitude; however, whether injection conditions at the pulsar are responsible for the observed jet-equator geometry of the Crab and Vela pulsars is currently under investigation. We also comment on the electrodynamics of the simulated magnetospheres, their current closure, and future simulations.},

The discussion is concerned with the class of (mainly young) pulsars which can sustain pair production in otherwise charge-depleted regions of the outer magnetosphere. The resulting electrostatic accelerating region ("gap") is expected to exist far from the neutron star, where a corotating magnetosphere would be rotating at speeds a significant fraction of c. The size and location of this gap supports the production of energetic radiation beams of quite different character from the usual coherent microwave emission of radio pulsars.},

	abstract = {We report the results of an investigation of particle acceleration and electron-positron plasma generation at low altitude in the polar magnetic flux tubes of rotation-powered pulsars, when the stellar surface is free to emit whatever charges and currents are demanded by the force-free magnetosphere. We apply a new 1D hybrid plasma simulation code to the dynamical problem, using Particle-in-Cell methods for the dynamics of the charged particles, including a determination of the collective electrostatic fluctuations in the plasma, combined with a Monte Carlo treatment of the high-energy gamma-rays that mediate the formation of the electron-positron pairs. We assume the electric current flowing through the pair creation zone is fixed by the much higher inductance magnetosphere, and adopt the results of force-free magnetosphere models to provide the currents which must be carried by the accelerator. The models are spatially one dimensional, and designed to explore the physics, although of practical relevance to young, high-voltage pulsars. We observe novel behaviour (a) When the current density j is less than the Goldreich-Julian value (0 {\textless} j/jGJ {\textless} 1), space charge limited acceleration of the current carrying beam is mild, with the full Goldreich-Julian charge density comprising the charge densities of the beam and a cloud of electrically trapped particles with the same sign of charge as the beam. The voltage drops are of the order of mc2/e, and pair creation is absent. (b) When the current density exceeds the Goldreich-Julian value (j/jGJ {\textgreater} 1), the system develops high voltage drops (TV or greater), causing emission of curvature gamma-rays and intense bursts of pair creation. The bursts exhibit limit cycle behaviour, with characteristic time-scales somewhat longer than the relativistic fly-by time over distances comparable to the polar cap diameter (microseconds). (c) In return current regions, where j/jGJ {\textless} 0, the system develops similar bursts of pair creation. These discharges are similar to those encountered in previous calculations by Timokhin of pair creation when the surface has a high work function and cannot freely emit charge. In cases (b) and (c), the intermittently generated pairs allow the system to simultaneously carry the magnetospherically prescribed currents and adjust the charge density and average electric field to force-free conditions. We also elucidate the conditions for pair creating beam flow to be steady (stationary with small fluctuations in the rotating frame), finding that such steady flows can occupy only a small fraction of the current density parameter space exhibited by the force-free magnetospheric model. The generic polar flow dynamics and pair creation are strongly time dependent. The model has an essential difference from almost all previous quantitative studies, in that we sought the accelerating voltage (with pair creation, when the voltage drops are sufficiently large; without, when they are small) as a function of the applied current. The 1D results described here characterize the dependence of acceleration and pair creation on the magnitude and sign of current. The dependence on the spatial distribution of the current is a multi-dimensional problem, possibly exhibiting more chaotic behaviour. We briefly outline possible relations of the electric field fluctuations observed in the polar flows (both with and without pair creation discharges) to direct emission of radio waves, as well as revive the possible relation of the observed limit cycle behaviour to microstructure in the radio emission. Actually modelling these effects requires the multi-dimensional treatment, to be reported in a later paper.},

Although progress has been made in understanding the relevant processes involved, there are several widely held misconceptions that are inhibiting further advances. These include the idea that plasma ``must'' be accelerated from the magnetic polar caps (the basis for the ``Hollow Cone Model'') and the idea that winds would be driven away by centrifugal forces, with large amplitude electromagnetic waves playing no role whatsoever. However, recent theoretical work is converging on a picture that closely resembles the latest HST and Chandra images, providing hope for the future. No less than three groups have recently confirmed the early Krause-Polstorff-Michel simulations showing that the fundamental plasma distribution around a rotating neutron star consists of two polar domes and an equatorial torus of trapped nonneutral plasma of opposite sign charges. Unless a lot of new physics can be added, this distribution renders the Goldreich-Julian model irrelevant (i.e., along with most of the theoretical publications over the last 33 years).},

Recent observations suggest that these models are likely to co-exist in the same magnetosphere. If so, their mutual relation is known to be troublesome (Harding 2009), due to the boundary conditions and the direction of the current, which are properly assumed in each acceleration model. We performed a particle simulation for the global magnetospheric structure. Based on this simulation, we present a new picture of the global structure of the pulsar magnetosphere. It is found that a new dead zone is formed along the current neutral line that separates the oppositely directed current. We shall call this the current-neutral zone. We suggest that the polar cap accelerators and the slot gaps locate above the current-neutral zone, and the outer gap exist between the current neutral zone and the traditional dead zone.

Treating electrons and positrons separately, AE seems to give a faithful description of the flow of charges in a pulsar magnetosphere. AE might allow to calculate the pulsar emission in full detail, at all energies except the radio. But AE is not a full theory -- the plasma production processes must be added. Here we show that the pulsar magnetosphere and the resulting emission are sensitive to the plasma production rate near the light cylinder. In strong pulsars (high production rate, due to photon-photon collisions), the number of field lines closing beyond the light cylinder decreases. This reduces both the pulsar efficiency (the ratio of the pulsed bolometric luminosity to the spin-down power) and the characteristic photon energy, in overall agreement with the Fermi data. For weak pulsars (low production rate), our numerical implementation of AE works stably and seems to be ready to calculate the lightcurves and spectra. But for strong pulsars, the code (included) needs improvement or better understanding.},

	abstract = {We present a new model of high-energy light curves from rotation-powered pulsars. The key ingredient of the model is the gap region (i.e., the region where particle acceleration is taking place and high-energy photons originate) that satisfies the following assumptions: (1) the gap region extends from each polar cap to the light cylinder; (2) the gap is thin and confined to the surface of last open magnetic-field lines; (3) photon emissivity is uniform within the gap region. The model light curves are dominated by strong peaks (either double or single) of caustic origin. Unlike other pulsar models with caustic effects, the double peaks arise from a crossing two caustics, each of which is associated with a different magnetic pole. The generic features of the light curves are consistent with the observed characteristics of pulsar light curves: (1) the most natural (in terms of probability) shape consists of two peaks (separated by 0.4 to 0.5 in phase for large viewing angles); (2) the peaks possess well-developed wings; (3) there is a bridge (interpeak) emission component; (4) there is a nonvanishing off-pulse emission level; (5) the radio pulse occurs before the leading high-energy peak. The model is well suited for four gamma-ray
pulsars-Crab, Vela, Geminga, and B1951+32-with double-peak light curves exhibiting the peak separation of 0.4 to 0.5 in phase. Here we apply the model to the Vela pulsar. Moreover, we indicate the limitation of the model in accurate reproducing of the light curves with single pulses and narrowly separated (about 0.2 in phase) pulse peaks. We also discuss the optical polarization properties for the Crab pulsar in the context of the two-pole caustic model.},

	abstract = {A model for the plasma atmosphere about a rotating magnetized neutron star with aligned magnetic and rotational axes is developed using a gedanken experiment in order to avoid considering at one time all of the phenomena produced by the extreme parameters associated with real pulsars. In this approach, the angular velocity of the star is
adiabatically increased in time, with the two axes aligned so that no dependence on the toroidal variable is introduced. The conclusions which appear to yield a consistent model are: (1) the star acquires a net charge that produces a monopole electric field which dominates the dipole magnetic field at large distances and causes particles emitted at the polar caps to cross the magnetic surface at these distances, forming a current loop between the caps and the polar annuli; (2) the primary current loop is not connected to the nebula and produces no energy loss due to particle emission into it; (3) a steady-state (possibly
turbulent) component of the atmosphere exists around a force-free surface which forms a dome over the polar cap; (4) the dome will have a continuous influx from primary beam particles, which are trapped due to their radiation loss; and (5) the toroidal drift velocity is not corotational, which is consistent with closed magnetic-field lines.},

	abstract = {In a previous work, we have shown that the electrospheric plasma of a pulsar's magnetosphere with vacuum gaps is subject to differential rotation in the equatorial belt. Here we examine the stability of a simplified model of this belt. The model consists of a charged thin plasma disc in differential rotation, embedded in a dipolar magnetic field anchored in the neutron star. In the linearized electrostatic perturbation approximation, this disc appears to be unstable to the so-called diocotron instability. We present several eigenspectra and eigenfunctions for different disc models, which differ by the total charge of the disc-star system. Velocity and electric field
perturbations are also shown in the disc plane for a few fast-growing modes. Increasing the total charge has a stabilizing effect, in the sense that the growth rate of the fastest-growing eigenvalue decreases with total charge and eventually vanishes. When the system is unstable, the growth rates are of the order of the azimuthal rotation rate. This means that the diocotron instability, which develops in a few pulsar's periods, should be very efficient in causing particles to migrate across magnetic surfaces.},

	abstract = {In order to construct an axisymmetric model of magnetospheres with centrifugal wind, especially of the type II magnetosphere described by Shibata and Kaburaki (1984), a numerical iterative scheme is presented in which a tenuous plasma with conspicuous transfield motion is treated self-consistently with the electromagnetic field. Since the
characteristic equations of the flow are solved, there are no numerical diffusion terms obscuring the cause of the transfield motion. The obtained properties of type II magnetosphere are as follows: plasma particles in fact flow out across the closed magnetic-field lines; centrifugal force is exerted powerfully on the positive particles to form a disk-like structure, and the strong electric force makes the negative particles drift to the disk; and the electric field parallel to the disk (Ep) appears and is shown to be necessary for the steady wind to exist. Within the range of the model parameters selected, two reasons for the appearance of Ep are found: plasma density decreases owing to the centrifugal acceleration and becomes insufficient to shield Ep, and the plasma with large inertia moves so as to reduce the charge
separation, which would be necessary to shield Ep.},

	abstract = {The main issue regarding the pulsar magnetosphere is how the rotation 
power is converted into both particle beams which cause pulsed
emissions, and a highly relativistic wind of electron-positron plasmas
which forms surrounding nebulae shining in X-rays and TeV $\gamma$-rays.
As a sequel to our previous paper, we carried out a three-dimensional
particle simulation for the axisymmetric global magnetosphere. We
present the results of additional calculations, which are higher
resolution models and higher pair creation rate cases, and a detailed
analysis for the solution. We confined our work to demonstrating the
cases of low pair creation rates, i.e. where the magnetic field is a
fixed dipole. The radiation drag of the plasma was taken to be in a form
with the curvature radius along the dipole magnetic field. The
electrostatic interactions were calculated using a programmable
special-purpose computer, GRAPE-DR. We found that once pair creation
begins in the outer gaps, both positively and negatively charged
particles begin to drift across the closed magnetic field due to
radiation drag, and they create an outflow. Eventually, the steady
magnetosphere has outer gaps, both positively and negatively charged
outflow of plasma and a region in which the electric field is dominant
extending from the equator. In the steady state, the magnetic field
generated by the magnetospheric current is comparable to the dipole
magnetic field outside several light radii from the star. In a much
higher pair creation rate model, the effect of the modification of the
magnetic field will bring about modification of the outflow of the
plasma, requiring further study with a higher pair creation rate model
in a subsequent paper.},
